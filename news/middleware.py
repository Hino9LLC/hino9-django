"""
Database resilience middleware with exponential backoff retry.

Automatically retries database operations during brief outages (e.g., database restarts).

This middleware is critical for the production deployment workflow where the database
is periodically replaced with a fresh copy from the local curation process. During the
~5-second replacement window, this middleware ensures users experience zero downtime
by automatically retrying failed requests.

Key Features:
- 30-second retry window with exponential backoff (200ms â†’ 3s)
- Smart 500 error detection (only retries actual database failures, not app bugs)
- Path whitelisting to avoid delays on static files
- 15 retry limit to prevent connection spam
- Works with both DEBUG=True and DEBUG=False

    Middleware that retries requests on database connection failures with exponential backoff.

    Only applies to database-dependent paths (whitelist approach) to avoid unnecessary delays
    for static files, health checks, and other non-database endpoints.

    Retries for up to 30 seconds to handle temporary database outages during deployments,
    restarts, or network hiccups. This allows the browser to "wait" while the database
    recovers, providing a seamless user experience.
